### 🌱 What I'm currently learning
I'm currently learning the Godot engine and the GDScript language, that's what I'm putting the most emphasis on. In addition, I'm constantly trying to find myself in the field of Computer Science, so I'm further educating myself in the C# language, in which I already have professional experience, and following new information from the programming world to try something new.

### ⚡ Fun facts
- I am an avid gamer, I like to get achievements in games by testing them to the limit and play them to 100%. (Yes I am a ~~crazy~~ completionist 🤪).
- I play guitar and kalimba, in which I find a moment of relaxation. (Of course, games are also relaxing, nevertheless, listening to the sounds I make on the instrument myself is extremely calming 😄).
- To refresh my mind, I regularly exercise at the gym, which allows me to take my mind off intense problem-solving for a while and focus on improving my posture. (Sometimes I take on the role of a trainer 😁).
